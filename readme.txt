This assignment only provided the handout and training&test data files which are in ass3DataFiles directory.

you need to write everything by yourself based on datafiles and the handout.
You can use slides for help, hope you can learn something. :)

Hint: Please do not just copy since you can not learn anything from it!!!

I have done part 1, 2, 3.
I have merged part1,2,3 report together, 
which named as report_allParts.pdf, please just read this report.

To run my part2, please use the following command:
java -jar a3part2.jar

My algorthim got correct result but there are lots of reduntant code, for example, I construct several hashMaps, but I just use one of them which is in getSingleLikelihood() method, which means very bad and I didnt plan it very well before writing, please notice that and not be confused within my code.

If you are lost in my code, you can check the history commit, hope that can help.
